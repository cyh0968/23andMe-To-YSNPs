# 23andMe To YSNPs 

## About
If you have a 23andMe raw data file which contains Y-DNA data with refSNPs/RSID but not the names of Y-SNPs in ISOGG format, this tool will help you. Please note that only positions of build 37 are supported. Pre-built executables are available in [releases](https://github.com/fiidau/23andMe-To-YSNPs/releases/latest)

## Usage
Open the 23andMe raw data and save the Y-SNPs. After saving the Y-SNPs, you may want to look at ISOGG Y-Tree 2014
